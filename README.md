# videoediting-scripts

This repo contains my python scripts for reencoding/editing
videos with the help of the awesome av1an and multiple
other pieces of software.

# Installation

If you want to use these scripts to you just need to have nix
setup with flakes and use the command `nix develop` to automatically
install all the tools needed for the scripts to run. Alternatively
nix direnv works too.
